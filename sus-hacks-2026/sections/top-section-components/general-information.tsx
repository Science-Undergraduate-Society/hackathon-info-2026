                    Join us in-person February 7-8, 2026, for an incredible weekend of
                    ideas, creativity, and collaboration. Maybe you’ll code your first
                    app, sketch a new design, solve a big challenge, or just try
                    something completely new.

                    Hackathons aren’t about being the “best coder in the room.” They’re
                    about learning, experimenting, and creating together. Bring your
                    curiosity and we’ll provide the rest.

                    Hack the Coast is UBC Science’s first-ever hackathon, built to
                    connect disciplines, spark ideas, and give everyone a chance to
                    explore what’s possible.

                    Think of it as a 24 hour playground for ideas. You’ll form a team,
                    dream up a project, and bring it to life: whether it’s an app, a
                    game, a website, or something no one’s seen before. Along the way,
                    you’ll learn from mentors, attend workshops, meet incredible people,
                    and get a LOT of free swag.
